This is a site I'm currently making for a local business. This serves as practice and also helping out a family owned business by making this site. I initially had it setup within my portfolio page, but I couldn't seem render to out the page so that's what i'm currently trying to fix.



edit: I know what the issue, but haven't gotten around to fixing it.
